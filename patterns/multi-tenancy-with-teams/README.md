# Multi-Tenancy w/ Teams

This pattern demonstrates how to provision and configure a multi-tenancy Amazon EKS cluster with safeguards for resource consumption and namespace isolation.

This example solution provides:

- Two development teams - `team-red` and `team-blue` - isolated to their respective namespaces
- An admin team with privileged access to the cluster (`team-admin`)
